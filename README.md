# Nutripal Mobile

## Project Background
Indonesia faces many nutritional problems, as evidenced by the cases of stunting in children (according to data from WHO and UNICEF, about 27% of children under 5 years old in Indonesia suffer from stunting), obesity, high prevalence of diabetes (based on the Kemenkes RI, the number of people with diabetes in Indonesia could reach 30 million by 2030), and chronic energy deficiency in pregnant women. The factors contributing to these problems is that people consume food that does not provide a balanced nutritional intake.
Considering the deficiencies in the nutrition sector, we want to help raise awareness about nutrition and change the culture of eating by making access to information about nutrition and health more accessible. This app can allow users to know their personalized balanced nutritional intake requirements from their age, weight, height, activity level, goals, and diet type.
In addition, the app can also provide food recommendations needed to meet those nutritional requirements, taking into account dietary restrictions. We believe our app can help the Indonesian population meet standard nutritional needs.
